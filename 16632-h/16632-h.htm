<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here as one people, night and day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For victory we work and pray.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor race nor creed shall difference make,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Nor bigot mar the zealot's plan;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We give our all for Freedom's sake,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of them who die for truth to-day!</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A cry of terror in the night;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A ship on work of mercy bent&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A carrier of the sick and maimed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beneath the cruel waters sent,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And those that did it, unashamed.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A woman who had tried to fill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A mother's place; had nursed the ill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And soothed the troubled brows of pain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And earned the dying's grateful prayers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Before a wall by soldiers slain!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And such a poor pretext was theirs!</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Old women pierced by bayonets grim</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And babies slaughtered for a whim,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cathedrals made the sport of shells,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">No mercy, even for a child,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As though the imps of all the hells</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Were crazed with drink and running wild.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All this we fight&mdash;that some day when</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Good sense shall come again to men,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our children's children may not read</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">This age's history thus defamed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And find we served a selfish creed</span><br />

<h2><a name="America" id="America"></a><i>America</i></h2><br /><br />




<span style="margin-left: 2em;">God has been good to men. He gave</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His Only Son their souls to save,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then he made a second gift,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which from their dreary lives should lift</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The tyrant's yoke and set them free</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From all who'd throttle liberty.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He gave America to men&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fashioned this land we love, and then</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Deep in her forests sowed the seed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which was to serve man's earthly need.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When wisps of smoke first upwards curled</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From pilgrim fires, upon the world</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unnoticed and unseen, began</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">God's second work of grace for man.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here where the savage roamed and fought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">God sowed the seed of nobler thought;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here to the land we love to claim,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The pioneers of freedom came;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here has been cradled all that's best</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In every human mind and breast.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For full four hundred years and more</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our land has stretched her welcoming shore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To weary feet from soils afar;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Soul-shackled serfs of king and czar</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Have journeyed here and toiled and sung</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And talked of freedom to their young,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And God above has smiled to see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This precious work of liberty,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And watched this second gift He gave</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The dreary lives of men to save.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And now, when liberty's at bay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And blood-stained tyrants force the fray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Worn warriors, battling for the right,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hear in the dark through which they grope</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">America's glad cry of hope:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Man's liberty is not to die!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">America is standing by!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">World-wide shall human lives be free:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">America has crossed the sea!</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">America! the land we love!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">God's second gift from Heaven above,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Builded and fashioned out of truth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sinewed by Him with splendid youth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For that glad day when shall be furled</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All tyrant flags throughout the world.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For this our banner holds the sky:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That liberty shall never die.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The things that make a soldier great and send him out to die,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To face the flaming cannon's mouth, nor ever question why,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Are lilacs by a little porch, the row of tulips red,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The peonies and pansies, too, the old petunia bed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The grass plot where his children play, the roses on the wall:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis these that make a soldier great. He's fighting for them all.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis not the pomp and pride of kings that make a soldier brave;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis not allegiance to the flag that over him may wave;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For soldiers never fight so well on land or on the foam</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As when behind the cause they see the little place called home.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Endanger but that humble street whereon his children run&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You make a soldier of the man who never bore a gun.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The little garden far away, the budding apple trees,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And homesick soldiers far away know spring is in the air;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The tulips come to bloom again, the grass once more is green,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And every man can see the spot where all his joys have been.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He sees his children smile at him, he hears the bugle call,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ingram saw the streak of danger, but he saw a little more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A greater menace faced them than that missile had in store;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If those deep sea bombs beside him were not thrown beneath the wave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Every man aboard the Cassin soon would find a watery grave.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Last year he heard the reindeers paw the roof above his head,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Last Christmas morn his daddy rose at dawn with him to play;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This year he'll hang his stocking by the chimney, but the hands</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He is too young to understand his mother's troubled glance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But he that was his Santa Claus is in a trench in France.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Somewhere in France this Christmas Eve a soldier brave will be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all that night in fancy he will trim a Christmas tree;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all that night he'll live again the joys that once he had</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When he was good St. Nicholas unto a certain lad.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he will wonder if his boy, by any sad mischance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Will find his stocking empty just because he serves in France.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then a bright-eyed young fellow came in with the meat,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The roses haven't changed a bit, nor have the peonies stranged a bit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">They bud and bloom the way they did before the war began.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The world is upside down to-day, there's much to make us frown to-day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And gloom and sadness everywhere beset the path of man.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But now the lilacs bloom again and give us their perfume again</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And now the roses smile at us and nod along the way;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And it is good to see again the blossoms on each tree again</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And feel that nature hasn't changed the way we have to-day.</span><br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh, we have changed from what we were, we're not the carefree lot we were,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Our hearts are filled with sorrow now and grave concern and pain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But it is good to see once more the budding lilac tree once more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And find the constant roses here to comfort us again.</span><br />

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
